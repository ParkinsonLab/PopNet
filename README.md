Note: Program will not work on Windows!

To Run:
	Extract contents to local folder
	Edit config file
	cd /path/to/local_folder
	python PopNet/FullRunner.py /path/to/config/file

###Introduction

PopNet is a set of Python scripts that generates a XGMML file to be visualized in Cytoscape. The scripts are run
by executing the runner script, FullRunner.py, with the path to a configuration file as argument. All configurable
options of the program are contained in the configuration file. The output XGMML file need to be manually loaded
into cytoscape for visualization. Information from several steps of the program are written to other files in the
output folder, which may be useful for extracting particular bits of information, optimizing parameters, or debugging

###Input Requirements

PopNet accepts two types of input: individual .snps files as generated by the Nucmer pipeline or tabular files 
containing SNPs for all samples. However, the two types can not be mixed in a single analysis. For snps files, 
one .snps file for each sample must be present in the folder specified by 'base_directory' in the config file. 
For the tabular format, a single .txt file matching the name specified by 'filename' must be present in the 
'base_directory' folder. Examples of both file types are available in the Examples folder.

PopNet expects that all individual genomes to be aligned to a common reference. In other words, that the coordinates
in each genome refers to the same location. In addition, all chromosome names should be in the format:
	XXXX_ChrI
	XXXX_ChrXIV

###Configuration File

The locations of input files, output files, and a number of run-time parameters are set using a configuration
file formatted according to the Python configparser module. Multiple instances of PopNet may be run in parallel
using different (or the same) configuration files. 

Each option in the configuration file is explained in the templates Example_Config_Toxo.txt and Example_Config_Yeast.txt

###Output

Output files are generated at the location specified in the config file, and are always named the same way.

The key file for network visualization is located at:
	/path/to/results/cytoscape/cytoscapeGenome.xgmml

Other potentially helpful output include:
	Heatmaps.pdf               Metrics to help you decide on the Inflation (I) and Pre-inflation (pI) parameters for 
	                           secondary clustering

	log.txt                    A log file that includes all the run parameters

	Genome_nexus.nex           A neighbor-net of the population

	groups.txt.mci             The raw matrix used in secondary clustering. You can quickly try out the effects of
	                           different I and pI values.

	persistentResult.txt       The clustering results of each individual chromosome segment during primary clustering

	results.txt                A tab-delimited file containing all the SNPs used

	/cytoscape/tabNetwork.tsv  A tab-delimited file containing all chromosome paintings in the network. Useful for
	                           focusing on specific locations on the genome.	

The remaining files are either intermediate files or for debug purposes.

###Visualization

	Start Cytoscape
	Install the enhancedGraphics plugin if not installed
	Select 'Import Network from File'
	Find and Select 'cytoscapeGenome.xgmml' described in the Output section
	Select Layout -> Profuse Force Directed Layout or another of your choice
	In the Control Panel -> Style -> Properties -> Paint -> Custom Paint 1 select Image/Chart 1
	Image/Chart 1 will now be in the list of properties
	Under Image/chart 1, set Column = Gradient, Mapping Type = Passthrough Mapping
	The chromosome paintings will now be visible
	Adjust other visual properties as needed

###Examples

Two example datasets are provided, one for yeast in .SNPs format and one for toxoplasma in tabular format. Note that either format can be used for any species, the examples simply give two different species in two formats.

The two example configuration scripts can be used to analyze the example datasets. 

To run the yeast example:

First, edit the Example_Config_Yeast file to change the base_directory and output_directory to the absolute path of /examples/Nucmer and /examples/Nucmer/output on your computer. The prefilled default serves to illustrate the format, and will not work.

Then:
	cd PopNet
	python scripts/FullRunner.py Example_Config_Yeast.txt
	Open Cytoscape
	Select 'Import Network from File'
	Find and Select /examples/Nucmer/output/cytoscape/cytoscapeGenome.xgmml
	Follow subsequent steps described in Visualization to visualize

A similar procedure can be used to run the Toxoplasma dataset using Example_Config_Toxo.txt and /examples/Tabular/Toxo20.txt

Pregenerated results are already placed in the coresponding /output folders for reference.
